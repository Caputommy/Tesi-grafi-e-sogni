abstract = {Computer-based dreams content analysis relies on word frequencies within predefined categories in order to identify different elements in text. As a complementary approach, we explored the capabilities and limitations of word-embedding techniques to identify word usage patterns among dream reports. These tools allow us to quantify words associations in text and to identify the meaning of target words. Word-embeddings have been extensively studied in large datasets, but only a few studies analyze semantic representations in small corpora. To fill this gap, we compared Skip-gram and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) capabilities to extract semantic associations from dream reports. LSA showed better performance than Skip-gram in small size corpora in two tests. Furthermore, LSA captured relevant word associations in dream collection, even in cases with low-frequency words or small numbers of dreams. Word associations in dreams reports can thus be quantified by LSA, which opens new avenues for dream interpretation and decoding.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a scheme to reduce big graphs to small graphs. It contracts obsolete parts, stars, cliques and paths into supernodes. The supernodes carry a synopsis S_Q for each query class Q to abstract key features of the contracted parts for answering queries of Q. The contraction scheme provides a compact graph representation and prioritizes up-to-date data. Better still, it is generic and lossless. We show that the same contracted graph is able to support multiple query classes at the same time, no matter whether their queries are label-based or not, local or non-local. Moreover, existing algorithms for these queries can be readily adapted to compute exact answers by using the synopses when possible, and decontracting the supernodes only when necessary. As a proof of concept, we show how to adapt existing algorithms for subgraph isomorphism, triangle counting and shortest distance to contracted graphs. We also provide an incremental contraction algorithm in response to updates. We experimentally verify that on average, the contraction scheme reduces graphs by 71.2\%, and improves the evaluation of these queries by 1.53, 1.42 and 2.14 times, respectively.},

abstract = {The graph partitioning problem is that of dividing the vertices of a graph into sets of specified sizes such that few edges cross between sets. This NP-complete problem arises in many important scientific and engineering problems. Prominent examples include the decomposition of data structures for parallel computation, the placement of circuit elements and the ordering of sparse matrix computations. We present a multilevel algorithm for graph partitioning in which the graph is approximated by a sequence of increasingly smaller graphs. The smallest graph is then partitioned using a spectral method, and this partition is propagated back through the hierarchy of graphs. A variant of the Kernighan-Lin algorithm is applied periodically to refine the partition. The entire algorithm can be implemented to execute in time proportional to the size of the original graph. Experiments indicate that, relative to other advanced methods, the multilevel algorithm produces high quality partitions at low cost.},

abstract = {We present a depth-first search algorithm for generating all maximal cliques of an undirected graph, in which pruning methods are employed as in the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm. All the maximal cliques generated are output in a tree-like form. Subsequently, we prove that its worst-case time complexity is O(3n/3) for an n-vertex graph. This is optimal as a function of n, since there exist up to 3n/3 maximal cliques in an n-vertex graph. The algorithm is also demonstrated to run very fast in practice by computational experiments.}
